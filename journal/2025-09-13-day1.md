# Journal — 9-13-2025 — DAY 4

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned the difference between OLTP and OLAP
- I learned how to use Docker with ClickHouse
- I learned how to setup virtual environment for DLT
- I learned how to use dBeaver for data standardization
- I learned how to run a raw-clean-mart pipeline using dBT and dLT
- I learned about the importance of sandbox for analysis
- I learned how to integrate Metabase for visualization  to the pipeline
- I learned how powerful Python for pipeline creation

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **term** — my definition
- OLTP - Online Transaction Processing - Shows the live transactions
- OLAP - Online Analytical Processing - Shows the present and past data in the DB
- dbt - Data Build Tool - Useful for data cleaning and standardization
- dLT - Data  Load Tool - Used for data extraction
- CTAS - Create Table As Select - Generate a table from the result of SQl query

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Raw stays raw
- Communicate clearly
- Observe & log

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- To verify that there are missing values in the auto_mpg dataset, 
I wrote my own SQL query instead of using DBeaver's filter option,
as this approach helped me deepen my knowledge of SQL.


## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- How to create a pipeline from scratch?
- How to properly write scripts for the 3-stage pipeline?
- How to configure the Docker compose file from scratch?
- How to establish a remote setup from scratch?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] study other Docker commands
- [ ] study more about dLT
- [ ] study dBT

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://dama.org/dmbok2r-infographics/
- https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/command-line-interface

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

I'm surprised at how useful Docker in building a pipeline. 
Next time, I will study more about Docker commands and scripting for proper configuration.
Automate what you repeat and ensure proper documentation of the pipeline setup for maintainabiliy.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
